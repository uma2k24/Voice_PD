# Voice PD: conversational voice screening

The active backend follows our original proposal: an ElevenLabs voice agent,
live Parselmouth acoustic measurements, and a speaker-validated acoustic
classifier. Frontend work is deferred.

- Measures local jitter, local shimmer, HNR, smoothed cepstral peak prominence
  (CPPS), and glottal-to-noise excitation ratio (GNE), plus F0, formants and mean
  pulse period.
- Streams analysis of four-second microphone windows during the conversation.
- Supports Logistic Regression and Random Forest training with speaker-separated
  cross-validation, an age-50 coverage gate, and matched-task external evaluation.
- Uses a guided sustained vowel exercise when only a vowel-trained model is
  available. Unsupported speech tasks return measurements without a score.

**Start here: [conversational backend setup and API](docs/conversation_backend.md).**
Run `python -m uvicorn conversation_app:app` after installing
`requirements_conversation.txt` and configuring ElevenLabs.

Gemini generates explanations from server-computed measurements and scores.
Local credentials load from the Git-ignored `.env` file.
Scores are experimental model outputs, not diagnoses or personal disease
probabilities. openSMILE and embedding fusion are later stages.
The inherited recording demo and its historical results are documented below;
its models and metrics do not validate the new conversational classifier.

## 📊 The numbers

**Model comparison** (hand-crafted 54-feature voting ensemble vs wav2vec2):

| Metric | Hand-crafted | wav2vec2 | Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV AUC | 0.982 [0.974–0.989] | 0.970 [0.956–0.982] | HC in-distribution |
| Accuracy | 0.947 | 0.946 | Tied |
| Brier score | 0.048 | 0.050 | Tied |
| SNR < 8 dB robustness | ↓ degrades faster | ↑ more robust | **wav2vec2** |
| Cross-population | ❌ fails on Indian speakers | ✅ generalizes | **wav2vec2** |
| Interpretability | ✅ SHAP explainable | ❌ embeddings only | HC |

> McNemar's test (χ²=47.04, p<0.001) confirms a statistically significant difference
> in per-sample correctness, but overlapping 95% CIs show the models are **practically
> equivalent** on in-distribution data. The meaningful difference is generalization and
> noise robustness — which is why wav2vec2 is the deployed default.

## 🔬 Research contributions

### 1 — SHAP Explainability

TreeExplainer SHAP on the XGBoost sub-model of the tuned voting ensemble.

**Top 10 features by mean |SHAP|:**

| Rank | Feature | Mean \|SHAP\| | Clinical significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **DFA** | 1.208 | Long-range vocal correlations — primary PD marker (Little 2007) |
| 2 | MFCC_1_std | 0.747 | Timbral stability — novel extended feature |
| 3 | MFCC_9_mean | 0.716 | Spectral envelope — novel extended feature |
| 4 | MFCC_7_mean | 0.516 | Mid-frequency energy — novel extended feature |
| 5 | MDVP:APQ | 0.503 | Amplitude perturbation quotient |
| 6 | MFCC_11_mean | 0.464 | High-frequency energy — novel extended feature |
| 7 | HNR | 0.399 | Harmonics-to-noise ratio — vocal fold dysfunction |
| 8 | Shimmer:APQ5 | 0.388 | Amplitude perturbation |
| 9 | Shimmer:APQ3 | 0.380 | Short-term amplitude variation |
| 10 | MDVP:Fo(Hz) | 0.290 | Fundamental frequency |

DFA dominates with mean |SHAP| = 1.208 — more than 1.6× the second feature.
Four of the top 10 are MFCC-derived features absent from the original UCI set,
validating the 54-feature extension.

Run: `python scripts/shap_analysis.py` → `reports/shap/`

### 2 — Statistical Validation

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap 95% CI (wav2vec2 AUC) | **[0.956, 0.982]** |
| Bootstrap 95% CI (hand-crafted AUC) | **[0.974, 0.989]** |
| McNemar's test | χ²=47.04, **p<0.001** |
| Brier score — wav2vec2 | **0.050** |
| Brier score — hand-crafted | **0.048** |

Run: `python scripts/statistical_validation.py` → `reports/stats/`
Outputs: calibration curves, ROC comparison, CI table

### 3 — Noise Robustness

Tested at 5 SNR levels (−5 to 20 dB), 3 noise types (white, pink, mixed).

**Crossover at ~8 dB SNR:**

| SNR | Hand-crafted | wav2vec2 | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| −5 dB (very noisy) | 0.774 | **0.864** | wav2vec2 **+0.090** |
| 0 dB | 0.886 | **0.931** | wav2vec2 +0.045 |
| 5 dB | 0.944 | **0.958** | wav2vec2 +0.014 |
| 10 dB | **0.973** | 0.963 | HC +0.010 |
| 20 dB | **0.989** | 0.967 | HC +0.022 |

> Hand-crafted features outperform wav2vec2 in clean conditions (SNR ≥ 10 dB),
> but wav2vec2 is substantially more robust to noise — home recordings
> rarely exceed 10 dB SNR.

Run: `python scripts/noise_robustness.py` → `reports/noise/`

## 🛠️ Why this project exists

The starting point was a buggy student project. Silent feature-extraction failures
meant the model was running with its top 3 predictive features permanently set to
"training-set average." Random train/test splits inflated accuracy through subject
leakage. We found both, documented both, and rebuilt from scratch.

<table>
  <tr><th>🐛 Bug</th><th>💥 Impact</th></tr>
  <tr><td><code>Jitter(%)</code>, <code>PPQ</code>, <code>RAP</code> aliased to same Praat call</td><td>Three features held identical values</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>Shimmer(dB)</code> set to <code>APQ3</code> value</td><td>Wrong scale, wrong meaning</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>RPDE</code>, <code>PPE</code>, <code>DFA</code> + 3 more hardcoded to <code>None</code></td><td>🔥 Top predictive features never computed</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Random splits ignoring multiple recordings per subject</td><td>🔥 Subject leakage — accuracy was a mirage</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>nolds</code> not in <code>requirements.txt</code></td><td>DFA failed silently</td></tr>
</table>

## ⚡ The plot twist

```
   train Italian → test UCI:    AUC 0.31    🔻 worse than random
   train UCI    → test Italian:  AUC 0.55    ⚪ basically random
```

Models don't learn Parkinson's features — they learn language features.
This cross-corpus failure is underreported in the literature. We tested it,
documented it, and used it to motivate wav2vec2 as a language-agnostic alternative.

## ⚠️ Honest caveats

> 🩺 **Not a diagnostic device.** Research-grade only.

> 🧍 **One Indian healthy speaker tested** — we confirmed it correctly says "healthy"
> on four recordings. We have not tested an Indian PD patient.

> 🔬 **No Indian PD ground truth.** The cross-language story needs a labelled Indian corpus.

> 📉 **UCI within-corpus AUC is only 0.69** — 8 healthy subjects is not enough.

> 🕳️ **wav2vec2 embeddings are not interpretable.** Use the hand-crafted backend if
> SHAP explainability matters.

> 📏 **Threshold tuned on OOF predictions from training**, not a held-out set.

All results are reproducible. No held-out data was used for threshold tuning or
model selection — all metrics come from OOF predictions in subject-grouped CV.
